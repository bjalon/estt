Ecole Sainte Thérèse - Le Mans
====

This repository contains projects produced during my freetime for my children's school.

First project is a Library management for infant school/elementary school.

This project is totally free to use. Feel free to give me feedback. Thanks to Lise Kemen to help me on this project as my CSS Skills are so awful.
